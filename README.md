# What's this?

This is a ultra-simple Python script for satellite image classification, 
developed for the classes of Remote Sensing at NOVA IMS, **Nova University of Lisbon**. 

The script is simple and hackable, so that even the most doubtful student can start
to python their way into Remote Sensing. 

# What are the requirements?

* scikit-learn
* osgeo

# How to use it?

Just have a look at *example_supervised.py*.
